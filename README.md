# B-W-Colorising-Models

This is a repository for the course project for Practical Machine Learning and Deep Learning course in Innopolis University.  

The project is about image colorization of black and white images. Several well-established colorizing CNN and GAN models were tested and evaluated. We have also written our own CNN model, and evaluated it against the competition.

Examples of colorization produced by our model are given below:
